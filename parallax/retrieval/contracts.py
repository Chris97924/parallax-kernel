"""Immutable data contracts for the ADR-006 retrieval-filtered pipeline.

Every component in the retrieval/answer chain speaks these types. They are
intentionally frozen dataclasses with tuple-valued collections so an
evidence object can be hashed, cached, and safely shared across threads.

INITIAL priority ordering in ``INTENT_PRIORITY`` is provisional and will be
locked on Day-2 once the ambiguous fixture set is labeled.

"""GET /metrics — Prometheus text-format endpoint.

Wraps :mod:`parallax.obs.metrics` (in-house thread-safe Counter registry) and
exposes WS-3 shadow observability gauges:

* ``parallax_shadow_discrepancy_rate`` — current rolling-1h discrepancy rate
* ``parallax_shadow_checksum_consistency`` — current rolling-1h consistency
* ``parallax_shadow_log_records_total`` — record count in the rolling window

Auth posture
------------
* **Open mode** (no ``PARALLAX_TOKEN``, no ``PARALLAX_MULTI_USER``):
  unauthenticated. Same posture as ``/healthz``.
* **Auth configured**: requires the same bearer token as the rest of the
  API. Operators who deliberately want an open scrape endpoint (e.g.
  behind a private network or Cloudflare Access policy) can opt in by
  setting ``PARALLAX_METRICS_PUBLIC=1``.

The values themselves carry no PII or query contents — only aggregate
floats — but exposing them publicly still leaks ingest cadence, retrieve
volume, shadow discrepancy rate, and service-existence signals that an
attacker can use for reconnaissance. Defaulting to fail-closed when auth
is available keeps that signal off the public internet without
operators having to remember to gate it.

Disk reads are cached for ``_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`` so concurrent scrapes don't
re-walk the JSONL files. Tests can reset the cache via
``_reset_cache_for_tests()``.

"""Per-question Parallax store helpers.

LongMemEval protocol resets memory between questions: each question carries
its own haystack, so we spin up an isolated SQLite file per question, ingest
every turn as a :class:`parallax.Memory`, and tear down at the end.

This v1 uses Parallax as a session-indexed memory store; no LLM claim
extraction is performed. Retrieval falls back to the full memory dump,
which a 1M-ctx answer model can consume directly. A v2 adapter can layer
:func:`parallax.extract.extract_and_ingest` on top for claim-level
retrieval without changing this surface.

    """Retrieval-filtered transcript — reads from Parallax store, not from ``q``.

    The v1 pipeline built the answer prompt from ``dump_all_sessions(q)``,
    which walks the in-memory Question tuple and therefore never exercises the
    Parallax store we just ingested into. That bypass hid any breakage in the
    ingest/retrieve round-trip behind a 1M-ctx answer model.

    This helper closes the loop:

    1. Fetch every ingested memory row via ``memories_by_user(conn, ...)``.
    2. Score each row by lexical overlap with ``q.question`` (BM25-stub — no
       model dependency, deterministic, fast).
    3. Keep the top ``top_k`` rows, stop early once ``max_chars`` is reached.
    4. Emit a chronological transcript ordered by ``vault_path`` so temporal
       questions keep the user's original arrival order.

    The defaults are generous (64 rows / 40K chars) so short haystacks pass
    through unfiltered; narrow them to actually exercise retrieval pressure.

    Contract notes:

    * Returns ``""`` when the store is empty. Callers that treat an empty
      transcript as valid context will silently pass junk to an answer model;
      ``run_one`` guards against this when ``use_retrieval=True``.
    * ``max_chars`` is the soft cap on cumulative ``len(block)`` across all
       blocks beyond the first. The first block is always emitted even if
       it alone exceeds the cap — otherwise a single oversized memory would
       produce an empty transcript, which is a worse failure mode.
    * Ties in the relevance score (common when the question has zero lexical
      overlap with a row) break deterministically on ``vault_path`` so
      reruns produce bit-identical transcripts.

# ADR-006: Retrieval-filtered pipeline with intent router (xcouncil Phase 1)

## Status

Proposed — 2026-04-20, target v0.5.x (xcouncil Phase 1 ships inside the
v0.5.x LongMemEval retrieval-quality line, window 2026-04-21 to
2026-04-26 for the Cerebral Valley "Built with Opus 4.7" hackathon).

This ADR freezes the Day-2 implementation contract so the six retriever
strategies, the two-layer router, and the evaluation protocol can all
land in parallel without drifting on intent boundaries. It transitions
from `Proposed` to `Accepted` when `parallax/retrieval/classify.py` and
`parallax/retrieval/routes.py` land and the first xcouncil A/B run
reports the six-number tuple specified in §6 below.

Builds on [ADR-003](ADR-003-target-kind-split.md) (the `target_kind`
split informs per-intent table selection) and
[ADR-005](ADR-005-claim-content-hash-user-id-scope.md) (user-scoped
content hash; every retriever filters by `user_id` consistently).
Supersedes nothing.

## Context

The v0.5.0 LongMemEval Run A (2026-04-20, Pro-judge, 500Q) produced
oracle_full 87.2% and `_s` full-context 86.0%. Per-type decomposition
pinpoints multi-session (~160Q) and temporal (~105Q) as the segment
that drags the `_s` score: single-session-user is already 95.5%, so
moving `_s` from 86.0% toward 90%+ means buying accuracy specifically
on those ~265Q.

Full-context is the current default path: for every question, the
answerer sees the entire user vault. That has two costs:

1. **Token bill** scales linearly with vault size. At a 1592-memory
   corpus (current E:\Parallax DB) a single answer call already spends
   ~20k input tokens; at 10× that corpus size the full-context path is
   not affordable per-question at Pro-model latency and cost.
2. **Signal dilution**: long contexts wash out the precise temporal
   anchor or cross-session reference the question actually needs. The
   per-type gap (multi_session/temporal underperform while
   single-session-user excels) is consistent with this — when the
   relevant memory is easy to retrieve ("which city in the last
   session"), full-context works; when it requires filtering across
   sessions or along a time axis, full-context buries the signal.

A retrieval-filtered path — classify the question, fetch only the slice
that answers it, hand that slice (not the vault) to the answerer —
attacks both costs. The risk is double-scoring: if the router picks
the wrong intent AND the specialised retriever fetches a narrow wrong
slice, `_s` regresses below the 86.0% full-context floor. Run A's
86.0% is the hard floor this ADR must not let xcouncil Phase 1 drop
under.

This ADR freezes the pipeline shape now — before
`parallax/retrieval/classify.py` is written — so the retriever
implementer, the router implementer, and the evaluator do not each
invent different intent sets and then have to reconcile at A/B time.

## Decision

Parallax implements a three-stage pipeline — **Router → Retriever →
Answerer** — with the following frozen contracts.

### 1. Six intents (closed set) with deterministic priority

The intent set is closed at six. Adding a seventh requires a new ADR,
not a rule tweak in `classify.py`.

| Priority | Intent | Rule-layer keyword / regex signals                                  | Target retriever                        |
| -------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1        | `temporal`          | `before`, `after`, `when`, `on <date>`, `第幾天`, `之前`, `之後`, ISO-date regex | time-window + recency merge              |
| 2        | `multi_session`     | `上次`, `之前你說`, `剛剛`, `last time`, `across sessions`, `earlier session`  | cross-session canonical merge            |
| 3        | `preference`        | `prefer`, `like`, `hate`, `favorite`, `偏好`, `喜歡`, `不喜歡`               | canonical fact lookup (no recency)       |
| 4        | `user_fact`         | `my name`, `I am`, `I live`, `我的`, `我是`, `我住`                         | canonical fact lookup (no recency)       |
| 5        | `knowledge_update`  | `now`, `現在`, `最新`, `changed to`, `已改為`, `updated`                     | latest-N + old-value pair                |
| 6        | `fallback`          | (matched when no other rule fires OR both gates in §2 fall through)  | MMR top-k, no filter                     |

**Priority / tie-break rule (INITIAL).** When ≥2 rules fire, the
lower `Priority` wins. `INTENT_PRIORITY` in
`parallax/retrieval/classify.py` = `("temporal", "multi_session",
"preference", "user_fact", "knowledge_update", "fallback")`. This
order is author intuition, NOT validated against tie-break cases
(e.g. "when did I last say I prefer coffee" fires temporal +
preference + multi_session and currently routes to temporal when
preference is likely correct). Day-2 builds a ≥10-question fixture
and locks the permutation that maximises correctness at `Accepted`;
the constant name is stable. Confidence-weighted mixing is rejected
in Alternatives §2.

### 2. Router: two-layer gate with frozen thresholds

```python
def classify(q: str) -> Intent:
    r = rule_classify(q)             # regex + keyword; (intent, confidence)
    if r.confidence >= 0.80:
        return r
    l = gemini_flash_classify(q)     # Gemini 2.5 Flash, JSON schema
    if l.confidence >= 0.70:
        return l
    return Intent("fallback", 0.0)   # stable path — never wrong by contract
```

Initial thresholds: **rule layer `>= 0.80`**, **LLM layer `>= 0.70`**
— author-intuition defaults matched to the 60/30/10 target split, not
empirically calibrated; runtime-configurable via
`parallax/retrieval/classify.py:DEFAULTS`. **Calibration protocol**:
transition to `Accepted` requires sweeping the pair on the 200Q
labeled set and locking the values that maximise `router_acc ×
(cond_acc | correct_route)` subject to §3's `fallback_e2e ≥ 0.95 ×
full_context_baseline` CI gate. §3 is the PRIMARY invariant; specific
values are SECONDARY — better values that still satisfy §3 are
adopted without a new ADR.

The LLM layer is invoked only when the rule layer falls through, so
Flash quota is bounded to ≤40% of question volume in the worst case.

`gemini_flash_classify` uses a JSON schema that forces the model to
return exactly one intent from the six + a confidence in `[0, 1]`; a
malformed response is treated as confidence 0 and cascades to
`fallback`.

### 3. Fallback route contract (empirically-monitored floor)

The `fallback` retriever returns MMR top-k with `k = K_MAX` (default
`32`) over the user-scoped union of `claims` and `events`. This is a
**K_MAX-bounded SUBSET** of full-context, not a superset: MMR top-32
can omit the single memory full-context would have surfaced. The
86.0% `_s` floor is therefore an **empirical commitment measured at
A/B time**, not a construction-time guarantee.

To make it falsifiable, every xcouncil A/B report surfaces
`fallback_e2e` (end-to-end accuracy restricted to questions routed to
`fallback`) as the **sixth number** alongside §6's tuple. CI fails
any report where `fallback_e2e < 0.95 × full_context_baseline`
(initial tolerance; tunable on transition to `Accepted`). This gate
is the primary invariant; router, retriever, and threshold choices
are secondary to keeping `fallback_e2e` above the floor.

**Corollary.** When router confidence is uncertain, the system routes
to `fallback`, not to a guess — the empirical-floor argument holds
only if uncertain questions land in the measurable fallback bucket,
so §2 keeps two thresholds rather than a soft mixture.

### 4. Per-intent retriever strategies

All five specialised retrievers plus `fallback` emit the same
`RetrievalEvidence` shape: `{hits, stages, notes, sql_fragments}`.
This re-uses the `RetrievalTrace` skeleton that lands in
v0.5.0-pre5, so the existing `inspect retrieve --explain` CLI works
for every intent without per-kind branching.

- **temporal** — extract `since` / `until` anchors from the question
  via the same `_iso_normalize` used by `by_timeline` (microsecond-
  inclusive); fetch `events` and `claims` whose `created_at` falls
  in the window; rank by recency. If no date anchor is extractable
  (e.g. "when did Chris prefer coffee" without a temporal phrase),
  demote to `fallback` and note `"no_temporal_anchor"`.
- **multi_session** — resolve the session reference ("上次" → most
  recent prior `session.start` event before `now`; "第二次" → second
  `session.start`); canonical-merge rows sharing a `content_hash`
  across sessions; rank by `recency × salience` where `salience` is
  the per-user claim count on the subject (ADR-005 user scope).
- **preference** — `by_entity` exact subject match + top-3
  embedding neighbours on the subject; **no recency weighting**
  (preferences are treated as static unless `knowledge_update` fires
  instead). Claims only; events excluded.
- **user_fact** — same retriever as `preference`, different rule
  patterns. Claims only.
- **knowledge_update** — top-N (`N = 3` default) newest claims on
  the subject, plus the immediately-preceding claim with the same
  `(subject, predicate)` tuple so the answerer sees both old and
  new values and can phrase the supersession correctly.
- **fallback** — MMR with `k = K_MAX` over the user-scoped union of
  `claims` and `events`. No intent-specific filtering.

**Escape-hatch invariant.** Any specialised retriever returning
`< K_MIN` hits (default `K_MIN = 3`) must append a
`"demoted_to_fallback"` note to its `RetrievalEvidence` and re-route
the question through `fallback`. This keeps the no-regression
guarantee in §3 load-bearing even when a question technically
classifies but its specialised corpus is empty.

### 5. Evidence-only answerer prompt

The answerer receives only `RetrievalEvidence.hits` plus the
question. No vault dump, no session history, no intent label (the
intent is a routing input, not an answerer input — feeding it would
leak router confidence into the answerer and couple the A/B
decomposition in §6).

The answerer prompt contract adds one required output behaviour: when
`hits` do not support the question, the answerer MUST emit the literal
token `insufficient_evidence` as its sole answer. The scorer treats
`insufficient_evidence` as a **third bucket** — `abstain` — distinct
from both correct and incorrect. This matters because:

- Scoring abstains as wrong masks router/retriever failure as
  answerer hallucination in the per-type breakdown.
- Scoring abstains as correct would let a lazy answerer game the
  benchmark by abstaining on hard questions.
- The `abstain_rate` becomes a first-class debug signal alongside
  `router_acc`: a rising `abstain_rate` on questions the router
  classified confidently means the retriever is the bottleneck.

### 6. A/B evaluation protocol

Every xcouncil Phase-1 A/B report decomposes end-to-end accuracy into
a frozen six-number tuple. Reporting a single e2e accuracy number is
non-conformant; the eval harness and any CI job that publishes
xcouncil numbers MUST surface all six:

1. **`router_acc`** — `classify(q)` vs a human-labeled intent set of
   `N ≥ 200` questions sampled from LongMemEval (target: 200 labels
   covering all six intents, skewed toward the 265Q multi-session +
   temporal segment that motivates this ADR).
2. **`cond_acc | correct_route`** — end-to-end accuracy restricted to
   the subset of questions where the router chose the labeled intent.
   Isolates retriever + answerer quality from router quality.
3. **`oracle_router_e2e`** — end-to-end accuracy when the router is
   forced to the labeled intent (oracle). Upper bound on what
   retriever + answerer can deliver if the router were perfect.
   `oracle_router_e2e − cond_acc | correct_route ≈ 0` means the
   router is not the next thing to invest in.
4. **`full_context_baseline`** — Run A Pro-judge `_s` = 86.0% (as of
   2026-04-20). Every xcouncil report states this number verbatim
   next to its e2e so the reviewer can see the floor.
5. **`abstain_rate`** — fraction of questions where the answerer
   emitted `insufficient_evidence`. Reported as a total AND broken
   down by intent (so "abstain_rate on temporal" is a first-class
   signal).
6. **`fallback_e2e`** — end-to-end accuracy restricted to questions
   the router sent to `fallback`. CI gate: `fallback_e2e ≥ 0.95 ×
   full_context_baseline`; any report below this floor is rejected.
   Empirical enforcement of §3's no-regression commitment.

Reports that surface fewer than six numbers are rejected at review;
the CI job that publishes xcouncil eval artifacts enforces this by
checking for all six field names in the output JSON.

## Consequences

- **`parallax/llm/call.py` unification becomes a prerequisite.** The
  classifier (Gemini Flash) and the answerer (Pro-grade model) must
  share one transport with per-call model override so the router can
  swap models without duplicating HTTP / retry / cache code. This
  pulls the "gemini.py 抽 call(model, ...)" pre-work item in front
  of retriever implementation, not behind it.
- **Per-question cache becomes mandatory.** A single A/B run hits the
  classifier 500× and the answerer 500× per pipeline variant; without
  caching, iterating on retriever tuning is cost-prohibitive. Cache
  key is `(model, normalized_question)` for the classifier and
  `(model, normalized_question, evidence_hash)` for the answerer, so
  tuning the retriever invalidates only answerer entries.
- **Abstain introduces a third scoring bucket.** Downstream dashboards
  (Notion Parallax 3-Lane Roadmap, LongMemEval per-type table) must
  be updated to display abstain separately from correct/incorrect
  before Phase 1 ships, otherwise abstains silently count as wrong
  and mask the failure-mode attribution that §5 is designed to
  expose.
- **Day-2 retriever work is insulated from intent-set churn.** The
  six intents, the K_MIN escape hatch, and K_MAX are frozen; the
  priority order (§1) and router thresholds (§2) are INITIAL but
  their names and positions are stable. Retriever implementation
  reads the interface from §1 and §4 regardless of calibration.
- **The answerer no longer sees incidental vault content.** Any
  previously-silent assumption that the answerer could pick up
  cross-question context from the full vault (e.g. a persona prompt
  that relied on seeing policy claims mixed into every call) must
  become an explicit retrieval path (a new intent) or move into a
  system-prompt template.
- **Router mis-classification is bounded by CI, not by construction.**
  Worst case is a question routed to `fallback` that would have been
  better served by a specialised retriever. §3's `fallback_e2e ≥
  0.95 × full_context_baseline` gate — the sixth number in §6 —
  enforces the bound at A/B time; the §4 escape-hatch
  (`demoted_to_fallback`) makes the surface area grep-auditable in
  every `RetrievalEvidence`.
- **Unstated assumptions, now explicit.** *Events user_id scope*:
  ADR-005's user_id scope extends from `claims` to `events` for
  fallback's union and multi_session/temporal — minor widening, no
  new ADR. *Single-intent assumption*: `classify()` returns one
  intent; multi-intent falls through §1's tie-break (Day-2 fixture
  quantifies). *Label-distribution assumption*: 200Q labeled ≈ 500Q
  is assumed; first A/B run MUST report `classify()`'s 500Q
  distribution and flag any intent differing by >20%. *zh keywords
  LongMemEval-inert*: LongMemEval is English-only, so §2's ~60%
  rule-gate is English-driven.

## Implementation Plan

The execution contract for moving this ADR from `Proposed` → `Accepted`.
Adopts **`B + Day-2-pivot-to-C`** from the 2026-04-20 xcouncil stability
review (Gemini 3.1 Pro / Codex / Claude Sonnet, adjudicated by Opus
judge). Route B scored 48/60 as main track, Route C scored 50/60 as
Day-2 pivot branch, Route A (strict-serial per-file implementation)
scored 23/60 and is rejected — A defers retrieval-ceiling discovery
to Day-5 when sunk cost is maximal.

### Three-tier success gates (decision thresholds, not slogans)

- **Floor** — `fallback_e2e ≥ 0.95 × 86.0% = 81.7%`. Below this, halt
  all complexity additions; fix `fallback` retrieval first.
- **Target** — `e2e_acc ≥ 88%`. Above Floor, only add per-intent
  retrievers with proven bucket-level `route_gain > 0`.
- **Stretch** — `e2e_acc ≥ 91%`. Pursue only after Target is met and
  `router_acc` is stable.

### Six-day schedule (hackathon window 2026-04-21 → 2026-04-26)

**Day-1 — Measure the three unknowns in parallel**
1. `fallback-only ablation`: fix `K_MAX=32 / K_MIN=3`, sweep `K`,
   claims/events weighting, and dedup strategy. Output: `fallback_e2e`
   plus per-bucket failure table.
2. `200Q threshold sweep`: sweep `rule ≥ 0.80` / `Flash ≥ 0.70` and
   neighbouring pairs. Report `router_acc`, `cond_acc | correct_route`,
   and false-positive route rate; do NOT pick on accuracy alone.
3. `INTENT_PRIORITY ≥20-question fixture`: ambiguous / multi-intent /
   cross-session cases (upgraded from the §1 ≥10 minimum). Purpose is
   tie-break stability, not score.

**Day-2 — Hard decision branch (the C-pivot gate)**
Read Day-1 `fallback_e2e` and pick exactly one of:
- **≤ 87.5% → pivot to Route C**: abandon per-intent retrievers,
  invest Day-3~5 fully in `fallback` + evidence-prompt tuning, pin
  Target = 88%.
- **87.5%–89.5% → B-lite**: ship only 2 high-ROI buckets (`temporal`
  + `multi_session`); every other intent stays on `fallback`.
- **≥ 89.5% → full B**: ship 3–4 per-intent retrievers, pursue
  Stretch = 91%.

Day-2 EOD freezes: best `fallback` params, router threshold candidate
set, `INTENT_PRIORITY` permutation.

**Day-3 — Per-intent retrievers, verified one at a time**
- Implement one retriever, immediately run bucket-level A/B:
  `route_gain = e2e_on_route − fallback_on_same_bucket`.
- `route_gain ≤ 0` → withdraw the route, force its bucket back to
  `fallback`. Do NOT keep a losing route to avoid sunk cost.
- Only start the second retriever after the first proves net gain.

**Day-4 — Integration, guardrail, code freeze (EOD)**
- Router enables only proven-gain buckets; every other intent routes
  to `fallback`.
- Route-level guardrail: low router confidence OR sparse evidence →
  `abstain` or demote to `fallback`.
- Full six-number tuple report (§6).
- **Day-4 EOD code freeze**: router thresholds, MMR params, dedup,
  evidence formatting — no further structural changes.

**Day-5 — Final 24h, single-knob convergence**
- Only `per-intent abstain threshold` moves.
- Objective order: (1) never fall below Floor, (2) maximise `e2e_acc`,
  (3) keep `abstain_rate` from spiking unreasonably.

**Day-6 — Final eval and exit strategy**
Run three versions and submit the most defensible:
- `fallback-only` (保底 / insurance)
- `selected per-intent` (主力 / main)
- `full router enabled` (Stretch)

Selection rule: satisfy Floor → highest stable `e2e_acc` → if `full`
is high-score but high-variance, fall back to `selected per-intent`.

### Risk hedges (cross-referenced from §3 / §6 invariants)

- **Retrieval-ceiling risk** — Day-1 ablation exposes it; Day-2 branch
  refuses to build on an unmeasured ceiling.
- **Router compound-error risk** — Day-3 per-bucket `route_gain` gate
  + Day-4 guardrail ensure losing routes never ship.
- **Sunk-cost risk** — Day-3 one-retriever-at-a-time + immediate
  withdrawal rule keeps abandonment cheap.
- **Day-6 overfit risk** — Day-4 EOD code freeze + Day-5 single-knob
  rule prevents simultaneous multi-parameter tuning.
- **Baseline regression risk** — `fallback-only` stays production-
  viable throughout as a one-flag rollback.

### Transition criteria (Proposed → Accepted)

All four must hold:
1. `parallax/retrieval/classify.py` and `parallax/retrieval/routes.py`
   have landed with the frozen six-intent set and the frozen thresholds
   (or their 200Q-sweep replacement).
2. A first xcouncil A/B run has reported the full six-number tuple
   from §6 on a held-out sample.
3. `fallback_e2e ≥ 0.95 × 86.0%` (= 81.7%) on that report; any lower
   rejects the ADR for rework before Accepted.
4. `INTENT_PRIORITY` permutation is locked from the ≥20-question
   fixture; the `0.80 / 0.70` thresholds are re-stated (kept or
   replaced by the 200Q-sweep winner, which satisfies §3).

## Alternatives considered

1. **Single-stage retrieval with no router (one MMR retriever over
   embeddings for every question).** Rejected because the per-type
   Run A analysis shows temporal and multi_session questions need
   structural filters (explicit time windows, session anchors) that
   embedding MMR cannot express without a prohibitively high k. The
   cost to match specialised-retriever accuracy via MMR alone would
   push `k` past the point where the answerer's context again
   becomes the bottleneck — i.e. we end up re-creating the
   signal-dilution problem this ADR is designed to solve.

2. **Confidence-weighted mixture of intents (soft routing, union of
   per-intent evidence sets).** Rejected for two reasons:
   - Token cost balloons because the answerer receives the union of
     multiple specialised retrievers' hits; the main motivation
     (shrink context relative to full-vault) is defeated.
   - The A/B decomposition in §6 breaks: `router_acc` is undefined
     when no single intent is chosen, so there is no way to isolate
     router failure from retriever failure from answerer failure.
     The point of xcouncil Phase 1 is to produce that attribution,
     not to maximise raw e2e at the cost of unreadable diagnostics.

3. **End-to-end learned router (fine-tune a small model on labeled
   intents).** Rejected for Phase 1:
   - The 200Q human-labeled set is too small to train without
     leakage into the very evaluation the router is being scored on.
   - The rule + Flash two-layer gate is already cheap and auditable
     — a mis-classification has a grep-able root cause ("rule
     `temporal/before` fired with confidence 0.82") that a learned
     router obscures.
   - A learned router would need retraining every time the intent
     set changes; the rule + prompt approach is a two-line diff.
     Revisit in Phase 3+ once the intent set has actually stabilised.

4. **Put retrieval inside the answerer as a tool call (ReAct-style
   agent).** Rejected for Phase 1: introduces latency variance
   (variable tool-call depth) that makes the A/B comparison against
   a fixed-latency full-context baseline uninterpretable. Also
   re-introduces the "answerer sees everything" failure mode — the
   agent can tool-call itself back into vault-wide retrieval and
   silently undo the Phase-1 filtering. Reconsider in Phase 2 once
   the retrieval-filtered path has an oracle-bounded measurement.

5. **Skip the `insufficient_evidence` abstain token; score abstains
   as wrong.** Rejected because it collapses two distinct failure
   modes (router picked wrong intent; retriever fetched wrong slice
   within the right intent) into one scoring bucket, defeating the
   A/B decomposition. The abstain bucket is what makes `abstain_rate`
   by intent a first-class signal in §6.

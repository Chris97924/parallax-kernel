"""BUG 1+4 regression: by_timeline must not drop boundary / naive-ts events.

v0.5.0-pre1. See project_parallax_v05_retrieval_patch.md.

BUG 1 — microsecond boundary drop:
    now_iso() stores `...T12:00:00.500000+00:00` but the caller passes
    `until="...T12:00:00Z"`. After the legacy _iso_normalize (micro=0 →
    stripped) the stored string (pos-19 char `.`, ASCII 46) compares GREATER
    than the query string (pos-19 char `+`, ASCII 43) under SQLite lex
    compare, so `created_at <= until` evaluates FALSE and the boundary event
    disappears.

BUG 4 — naive-timestamp lex compare:
    A stored `created_at="2024-06-15T12:00:00"` (no tz) is SHORTER than a
    tz-aware query bound and loses the lex comparison via short-string-less
    semantics. _iso_normalize's until-expansion must produce a form that
    still compares correctly against naive stored strings.
